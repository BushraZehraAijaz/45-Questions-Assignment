// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

interface car {
    manufacturer: string;
    model: string;
    [key: string]: any;
}

function createCar(manufacturer:string, model:string, ...args: { [key:string]: any;}[]):car{
    let car:car = {manufacturer, model};

    args.forEach(args => {
        Object.keys(args).forEach(key => {
            car[key] = args[key];
        });
    });

    return car;
}
let car = createCar("Honda", "Civic", {color: "golden", year: 2023},{features: "sunroof"} );

console.log(car);
